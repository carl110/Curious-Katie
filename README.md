# Curious-Katie

This is project 4 of OpenClassrooms iOS Developer course

Scenario

We tend to surround ourselves with people who share similar interests to our own. How about learning something new?

Within this project, you will create an algorithm that will match people with different interests so that they can learn from each other.

Our smart algorithm, let’s call it "Curious Katie”, will help a group of people introduce themselves and partner-up for further conversation based on differences in their interests.

Your algorithm will emulate the preliminary session where participants introduce themselves and share their interests. After that, "Katie" will partner participants for further conversation.

You will not implement any graphic user interface (GUI) for this app and will observe the results exclusively in the Xcode console.
Algorithm requirements

The algorithm will accommodate the following conditions:

    It will work with 2-12 participants.
    Participants will introduce themselves one by one.
    After all the participants have introduced themselves, "Katie" will randomly nominate a participant to share one of their interests. Each nominated person will share one interest at a time.
    Once everyone has shared all of their interests, "Katie" will do the partnering.
    In the introduction, each participant will share their name and any additional characteristics of your choice (e.g. age, hometown, etc.). All participants will have unique names.
    Each person can have up to 10 possible interests.
    Each interest must have a title and optional additional information (e.g. a description, why they like it, required equipment or conditions, etc.).
